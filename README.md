# Dyanmic-Clipboard-Update
A project developed in C#, using EventHook package, that allows user to dynamically modify Clipboard Content on the occurence of a pre-defined Mouse or Keyboard Event.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Set <b>text</b> variable in the program to any string that you want to update word by word on Clipboard. <br>
<b>Run</b> the program.<br> Press <b>Tab</b> to update cliboard with the next word in string

<h2>Utility</h2>
I developed this program to ease the process of writing Call-Routing Vectors in Avaya Ecosystem. Currently there exists no method to 
import vectors from any source e.g. Excel file. Since vectors are programmed using keywords, copy-pasting individual lines of code doesn't work either.
Hence this program takes in a processed string and allows you to paste it in Vector script one word at a time, significantly reducing 
programming time.

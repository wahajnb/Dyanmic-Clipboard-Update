<h2>Utility</h2>
I developed this program to ease the process of writing Call-Routing Vectors in Avaya Ecosystem. Currently there exists no method to 
import vectors from any source e.g. Excel file. Since vectors are programmed using keywords, copy-pasting individual lines of code doesn't work either.
Hence this program takes in a processed string and allows you to paste it in Vector script one word at a time, significantly reducing 
programming time.
